# POST /api/textgen/

An API endpoint for requesting AI generated text. The text will be generated based on the prompt and contexts specified in the request. In the future the request body should include a list of prompt objects instead of a single object. The list in the response may not be in the same order as the list in the request.

## Request

```
{
    contexts: string[], //contexts/categories listed from highes to lowest level
    prompt: string, //the "main" prompt for the AI
    id: string
    //more fields can be added here later if/when required
}
```

There must be exactly two contexts listed: the theme and the category in that order.

## Response

```
{
    result: string, //the text generated by the AI
    id: string
    //more fields can be added here later if/when required
}
```
