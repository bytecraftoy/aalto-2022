# POST /api/textgen/

An API endpoint for requesting AI generated text. The text will be generated based on the prompt and contexts specified in the request. In the future the request body should include a list of prompt objects instead of a single object. The list in the response may not be in the same order as the list in the request.

}
```

## Response
